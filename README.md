## Development server

First make sure your development environment includes Node.js, npm and Angular CLI.

## Instalation 

Run `npm instal ` This command will take some time and install all the required libraries into the node_modules directory in order for you to start developing.

## Build

Run `npm start`  or  `ng serve --open` to build the project. 


## Running 

 Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
